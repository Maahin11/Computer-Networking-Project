# Campus Area Network System

## Overview
The **Campus Area Network (CAN) System** is a comprehensive network infrastructure designed for large educational environments. It incorporates advanced technologies to ensure high performance, security, and scalability.

## Project Details
- **Institution:** Green University of Bangladesh  
- **Course:** Computer Networking Lab (CSE-312)  
- **Submitted by:**  
  - Md. Jubayerul Hasan Mahin (213902127)  
  - Md. Nahid Hossen (221002610)  
- **Submitted to:** Sudip Chandra Ghoshal, Lecturer  
- **Semester:** Fall 2024  

## Features
- **Scalable Design**: Supports future expansion with a hierarchical and modular topology.
- **Advanced Security**: Utilizes VLANs, ACLs, NAT, and centralized authentication via Active Directory.
- **High Availability**: Includes redundancy mechanisms such as HSRP, OSPF, and EtherChannel.
- **Centralized Services**: DHCP, DNS, and file sharing for efficient resource management.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Simulation Tool:** Cisco Packet Tracer  
- **Routing Protocols:** Static routing, OSPF  
- **Security Mechanisms:** VLANs, Access Control Lists (ACLs), Firewalls  
- **Hardware Simulated:** Routers, switches, servers, and wireless access points  

## Implementation Workflow
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Identified connectivity and resource-sharing needs.
2. **Design**: Created a hierarchical topology with designated IP ranges for each department.
3. **Configuration**: Set up VLANs, routing protocols, DHCP, and DNS.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Verified connectivity and performance using simulations.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Routing Misconfigurations**: Addressed by thorough testing and adjustments to routing tables.
- **Scalability Issues**: Proposed dynamic routing protocols like OSPF for future implementations.
- **Security Enhancements**: VLANs were used to segment traffic and reduce security risks.

## Results
- Achieved seamless communication across departments.
- Validated network performance with minimal latency and no significant packet loss.
- Demonstrated scalability and robustness through simulated scenarios.

## Future Work
- Implement dynamic routing protocols like OSPF or EIGRP for better scalability.
- Integrate wireless access points to support mobile devices.
- Enhance security with advanced measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
